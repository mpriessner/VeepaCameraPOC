# VeepaCameraPOC

> Proof-of-concept for integrating Veepa IP cameras with iOS applications via Flutter Add-to-App.

## ⚠️ PROJECT ARCHIVED (2026-02-03)

**This POC has been successfully integrated into SciSymbioLens and is no longer actively developed.**

Testing confirmed that both this POC and SciSymbioLens experience the same 3-minute P2P disconnection issue (Veepa SDK limitation). All future development and fixes are in **SciSymbioLens**. See `docs/LEARNINGS.md` for details.

**For active development, go to:** `/SciSymbioLens`

## Purpose

This POC validates the Flutter Add-to-App integration approach for connecting Veepa cameras to native iOS apps. It de-risks the SciSymbioLens Phase 4 implementation.

## Status

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Pure Flutter POC | 📋 Planned |
| Phase 2 | Flutter Add-to-App | ⏳ Future |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (>=3.0.0)
- Xcode 15+
- Physical Veepa camera on local network
- iOS device for testing (simulator has limitations)

### Phase 1: Flutter POC
```bash
cd flutter_veepa_module
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Phase 2: SwiftUI Host
```bash
cd ios_host_app
xcodegen generate
open VeepaPOC.xcodeproj
```
